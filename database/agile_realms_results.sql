Stakeholders lose confidence in the ability of the team to handle challenges collaboratively. The focus shifts from addressing the missing feature to resolving internal conflicts, leading to delays and potential project failure.'),(7,7,'Your approach to determining the optimal number of sprints for the project is commendable. By integrating a comprehensive and collaborative strategy, you foster a transparent and inclusive decision-making process. This method ensures that various factors and potential challenges are taken into account, contributing to the overall success and efficiency of the project.','Your approach to deciding on the number of sprints demonstrates a focus on simplicity and efficiency. While this option may lack some of the formalities of a more structured approach, its emphasis on speed and simplicity can be advantageous in certain dynamic project environments, allowing for a swift adaptation to changing circumstances.','This worst-case scenario could lead to a lack of alignment, potential inefficiencies, and increased project risks due to the absence of a systematic and thoughtful approach to sprint planning.','In opting for a casual approach to determining the number of sprints, there is a risk of overlooking crucial considerations. This approach, while fostering a relaxed atmosphere, may compromise the depth of the decision-making process and the ability to address potential complexities in the project.'),(8,8,'Stakeholders appreciate the organized and inclusive feedback session, strengthening collaboration. The team gains valuable insights for refinement, and stakeholders feel heard and respected.','The open-ended discussions foster a sense of collaboration, and stakeholders appreciate the flexibility.

This strengthens collaboration and sets a positive tone for the upcoming work.','Video conferencing allows for effective communication, and the team reaches a consensus on the sprint plan. While not as interactive as the best option, it still ensures that important decisions are made collectively.','The text-only discussion results in some misunderstandings, and team members may not fully agree on the sprint plan. This could lead to a lack of clarity and potential issues during the execution of the sprints.','Postponing the meeting without clear communication creates uncertainty among team members. They may feel disengaged and frustrated, potentially impacting team morale and delaying project progress.'),(11,11,'The adapted sprint duration allows the team to manage their workload effectively.
